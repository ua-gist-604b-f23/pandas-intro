# Python Programming with Pandas
## Assignment
In this assignment you will learn about the `pandas` library. You will learn how to construct, inspect, and manipulate `pandas` `DataFrame`s as well as query them, summarize them, and join them with other `DataFrames`.

_If you are new to python programming, watch this 60-minute tutorial to help get started: [Learn Python in One Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)_

### Background
[`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. For open source vector-based GIS, pandas provides a fundamental data model for describing vector data; namely, the [`DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). `panda`'s `DataFrame` class provides a structure for `Two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data`. Does that sound familiar? This is essentially an attribute table, but without the spatial component. There is a spatial extension for the data frame but it will serve us better to explore the non-spatial `DataFrame` first, learn its usage, and understand how to manipulate, join, and query data that are stored in `DataFrame`s.

For this assignment we will be following lessons Hernan Rojas provided for us at https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas/src/master/.

### Lessons

#### Lesson 1
Follow the following tutorial and submit a screenshot named `lesson1.png` showing your spyder desktop at the last step. It should show the graph and the most popular name.

#### Lesson 2
Follow the following tutorial and submit a screenshot named `lesson2.png` showing your spyder desktop at the last step. It should show a table of names sorted by births and the associated graph.
- https://nbviewer.org/urls/bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas/raw/master/lessons/02%20-%20Lesson.ipynb

#### Lesson 3
Follow the following tutorial and submit a screenshot named `lesson3.png` showing your spyder desktop at the last step. It should show a figure containing the `TX` graphs.
- https://nbviewer.org/urls/bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas/raw/master/lessons/03%20-%20Lesson.ipynb

#### Lesson 4
Follow the following tutorial and submit a screenshot named `lesson4.png` showing your spyder desktop at the last step. It should show the last 5 records ot `df`.
- https://nbviewer.org/urls/bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas/raw/master/lessons/04%20-%20Lesson.ipynb

#### Lesson 5
Follow the following tutorial and submit a screenshot named `lesson5.png` showing your spyder desktop at the last step. Show the output of letterone without the index.

### Deliverable
You should have 5 screenshots:
- `lesson1.png`
- `lesson2.png`
- `lesson3.png`
- `lesson4.png`
- `lesson5.png`
 
Include those in a branch named `pandas` and submit a `Pull request` to merge with `master`. Do not merge!
